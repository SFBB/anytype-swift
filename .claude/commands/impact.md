USE EXTENDED THINKING

You are acting as a Senior iOS QA Lead reviewing code changes. Your task is to analyze the differences between two git commits and create a comprehensive testing impact report for your QA team.

## Input:
- Base commit: `[COMMIT_HASH_1]`
- Target commit: `[COMMIT_HASH_2]`

## Your Analysis Process:

### Step 1: Retrieve and examine the changes
Use git commands to:
1. Get the full diff with code changes: `git diff COMMIT_HASH_1..COMMIT_HASH_2`
2. Get detailed file statistics: `git diff --stat COMMIT_HASH_1..COMMIT_HASH_2`
3. List all changed files: `git diff --name-only COMMIT_HASH_1..COMMIT_HASH_2`
   - Group by: UI files, business logic, networking, data layer, configs
4. Look for project file changes: `git diff --name-only COMMIT_HASH_1..COMMIT_HASH_2 | grep -E '\.(xcodeproj|xcworkspace|pbxproj)'`
   - Check for new dependencies, build settings changes
5. Check Info.plist changes: `git diff COMMIT_HASH_1..COMMIT_HASH_2 -- */Info.plist`
   - Permissions, app capabilities, version numbers
6. Get commit messages: `git log --oneline COMMIT_HASH_1..COMMIT_HASH_2`
7. Check for any merge commits: `git log --merges COMMIT_HASH_1..COMMIT_HASH_2`

### Step 2: Categorize changes by impact
Think step-by-step about each change and classify it:

When analyzing iOS code changes:
- Look for UIKit/SwiftUI component changes
- Identify modified navigation flows, gestures, animations
- Check for Middleware model changes or migrations
- Notice Middleware endpoint changes or Middleware layer modifications
- Examine changes in app permissions, capabilities, or entitlements
- Look for localization updates

Example format:
```
File: LoginViewController.swift
Code Changes:
  - Modified Face ID authentication logic (line 145-167)
  - Added biometric fallback to passcode (line 201-215)
  - Changed error alert presentation style (line 89-95)
  - Updated keychain access method (line 234-240)
Change Type: Authentication Flow Modification
Impact: HIGH - Changes to user authentication and security
Affects: Login flow, biometric authentication, keychain storage, app security
Testing Required: Full regression on all authentication methods, keychain data persistence, error scenarios
Dependencies: Settings screen, user profile, any secured features
```

### Step 3: Provide Actionable Output

Structure your final report as:

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
- **Total impact score**: [High/Medium/Low]
- **Critical changes**: [Number]
- **Must-test features**: 
  - [Feature 1]
  - [Feature 2]
  - [Feature 3]
- **Estimated testing effort**: [Hours/Days]
- **Risk areas**: [Brief summary of highest risks]
- **Total files changed**: [Number]
- **Commit range**: `COMMIT_HASH_1` to `COMMIT_HASH_2`

## DETAILED IMPACT ANALYSIS

### 1. UX Changes
Do not include point if nothing is changed
- **Navigation flow changes**: [Describe any changes]
- **Animation/Transition updates**: [List any modifications]
- **Dark mode impact**: [Any specific changes]
- **Accessibility impact**: [VoiceOver, Dynamic Type, etc.]

### 2. Functional Impact by Area

#### High Priority Areas (P0)
For each area provide:
- **Component/Feature**: [Name]
- **What changed**: [Non-technical description]
- **Regression scope**: [Related features to verify]

#### Medium Priority Areas (P1)
[Same structure as above]

#### Low Priority Areas (P2)
[Same structure as above]

### 3. Technical Changes Requiring Special Attention
Do not include point if nothing is empty
- **Info.plist changes**: [Permissions, capabilities, URL schemes]
- **Entitlements**: [Push notifications, app groups, keychain]
- **Widget/Extension impact**: [If app has extensions]
- **Push notification changes**: [If applicable]
- **Deep linking changes**: [URL schemes, universal links]
